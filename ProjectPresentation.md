Introduction
========================================================
type: prompt

To satisfy the requirements of the Coursera *Developing Data Products* Course, the 9th course in the JHU Data Science Specialization Certification, an interactive Shiny application was built.

The [Shiny application](https://zellw.shinyapps.io/shiny2/) compares the population and land/water area using data from the 2000 and 2010 U.S. Census.

This presentation introduces you to the application and how it works.

What to Expect
========================================================
type: prompt

The default view shows the population of the 4 U.S. Regions for the 2000 Census

- The user can select a different dataset (Regions or Divisions) and choose between the 2000 and 2010 Census year.

- Any change the user makes will be immediately reflected.

- The default view presents a table.
